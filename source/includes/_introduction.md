# Introduction

Provide is an enterprise low-code application platform for distributed systems that makes it quick and easy to add blockchain to your organization's technology stack. This documentation describes the Provide architecture and a holistic suite of APIs made available by Provide for organizations and developers looking to build, test and scale Web3 applications and distributed systems.
