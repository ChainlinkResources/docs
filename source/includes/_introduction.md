# Introduction

Welcome to the [Provide Platform](http://provide.services) API. Provided here is all the documentation you need to orchestrate global blockchain networks and build revolutionary new decentralized applications and services using Provide.

# Platform Overview

Provide Platform is a scalable, chain- and protocol-agnostic PaaS for deploying public, private or permissioned blockchain networks. Provide creates a modern developer experience with easy-to-understand APIs. Provide Platform helps your blockchain developers operationalize smart contracts for use in decentralized applications and integrate with enterprise application architectures. The transaction, signing identities, oracles, bridges, smart contracts and other decentralized application elements are manageable using our [web UI](https://dawn.provide.services) or [CLI](https://github.com/provideservices/provide-cli). You can use Provide Platform to rapidly prototype a DApp or architect a new platform or network. Our abstraction layer makes deploying decentralized applications to production a seamless experience for DevOps.

Provideâ€™s structured platform abstracts away much of the DevOps and engineering overhead associated with blockchain projects. Your project can be up and running across thousands of nodes all over the world in minutes.
