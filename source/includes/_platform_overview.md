# Platform Overview

This overview provides an inventory of core APIs which are suitable for building all kinds of Web3 applications. The APIs enable users to orchestrate public and permissioned peer-to-peer infrastructure, connect that infrastructure with legacy systems and build sophisticated applications in a low-code environment.
